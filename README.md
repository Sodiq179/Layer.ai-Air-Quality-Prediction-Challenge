# Air-Quality-Prediction-Challenge

## Brief Description: 

The objective of this challenge is to predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration in the air for some locations in Uganda. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the most harmful air pollutants. PM2.5 is a common measure of air quality that normally requires ground-based sensors to measure. The challenge is part of the [Zindi Competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/layerai-air-quality-prediction-challenge).
